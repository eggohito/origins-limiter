# Limiter (Example for Base Origins)

This is the example datapack for limiting the base origins from the base origin layer. This can also be used as a template for limiting custom origins that are registered in the base origin layer. If you only want the barebone components to use for limiting custom origins, check out the [`api`](https://github.com/eggohito/origins-limiter/tree/api) branch.
