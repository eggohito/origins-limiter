# Limiter (Example for Origins: CLasses)

This is the example datapack for limiting the clases from Origins: Classes. This can also be used as a template for limiting custom origins that are registered in the `origins-classes:class` *(`data/origins-classes/origin_layers/class.json`)* origin layer. If you only want the barebone components to use for limiting custom origins, check out the [`api`](https://github.com/eggohito/origins-limiter/tree/api) branch.
