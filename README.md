# Limiter (Origins)

A datapack library that can limit how many players can have a certain origin.

If you want to do the manual work of integrating the datapack library to your datapack and need assistance, you can visit [the wiki](https://github.com/eggohito/origins-limiter/wiki) for more information or DM me (`eggohito#9048`) in Discord if you need further assistance.

If you don't want to (or don't know how to) do the manual work of integrating the datapack library to your datapack, you can create an issue using the ['requesting integration'](https://github.com/eggohito/origins-limiter/issues/new?assignees=eggohito&labels=request&template=integration-request.yml&title=%5BREQUEST%5D+%3Cdatapack%2Faddon+name%3E) issue template to this repository's issue tracker.
